# Character Encoding Fix for RI Tracker

## Issue Description
When running the application directly through `main.py`, the timer works fine, but when built as an executable with PyInstaller, stopping the timer causes an error:

```
An error occurred: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 14525-14527: character maps to <undefined>
```

## Root Cause
The issue is related to character encoding when printing data that contains non-ASCII characters. When the application is packaged with PyInstaller and run as an executable, the console output uses the system's default encoding (often 'cp1252' on Windows), which cannot handle certain Unicode characters.

The error occurs specifically when:
1. The application attempts to print the session update data, which may contain non-ASCII characters from browser history titles or application names
2. The Windows console cannot display these characters using the default 'charmap' codec

## Fix Implemented
We implemented a fix that prevents the encoding error by:

1. Modifying the print statement in `update_session()` to avoid printing the entire update data:
```python
# Use safe printing to handle non-ASCII characters
try:
    print("Update Session data prepared (details omitted for encoding safety)")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Print error: {str(e)}")
```

2. Adding error handling for print statements in the links processing:
```python
# Log metrics - safely handle potential encoding issues
try:
    print(f"Links processing metrics: Total={total_links}, Valid={valid_links}, Skipped={skipped_links}, Errors={error_links}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Print error in links metrics: {str(e)}")
```

3. Modifying error messages to avoid printing URLs that might contain special characters:
```python
try:
    print(f"Error processing link: {str(e)}")
except Exception as print_err:
    print(f"Print error: {str(print_err)}")
```

## Testing the Fix
We created a test script (`test_encoding_fix.py`) that verifies the encoding fix works correctly by:
1. Testing the original problematic print statement with non-ASCII characters
2. Testing our fixed approach that avoids printing the data directly
3. Testing an alternative approach using `json.dumps` with `ensure_ascii=True`

All three approaches worked in the Python environment, but our fix is the most robust as it completely avoids the potential encoding issue.

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Setting the console output encoding**: We could set `sys.stdout.encoding` to UTF-8, but this doesn't always work in all environments, especially in PyInstaller executables.
2. **Using `json.dumps` with `ensure_ascii=True`**: This converts all non-ASCII characters to their escaped Unicode representation, which is safe for any console encoding.
3. **Writing to a log file instead of printing**: This would avoid console encoding issues entirely, but would require additional setup.

## Conclusion
The implemented fix is minimal and robust, preventing the 'charmap' codec error when stopping the timer in the executable version. It maintains all functionality while ensuring the application works correctly in all environments.

## Build Instructions
Build the executable with PyInstaller using:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico --add-data "dist;dist" main.py
```
