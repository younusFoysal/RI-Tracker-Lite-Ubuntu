    Test the system-wide activity tracking functionality.

    1. Creates an instance of the Api class

    3. Waits for a few seconds to simulate activity
    4. Gets the activity stats
    5. Stops the timer

    - keyboard_activity_rate should be > 0 if keyboard activity occurred
    - mouse_activity_rate should be > 0 if mouse activity occurred
